## Sales Dashboard:
I downloaded data from internet but I don't remember the website. It contain's transactions of a hyperstore that sels different product categories. I prepared some KPIs in order to monitor the performance of the store, then I chose suitable visuals for KPIs and created my dashboard. It's worth to mention that I use PowerPoint to create the background of the dashboard.You can access the dashboard by downloading the 'Sales Dashboard.pbix'.

The dashboard appearance is:

## Human Resources Dashboard:
I downloaded Human Resources data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set), then opened it with Excel and got familiar with columns. After looking at data I prepared a list of KPI that I could calculate and visualised to monitor the HR department. After choosing appropriate visual for each KPI and placing them on the page, I created a background using PowerPoint and imported as a wallpaper to PowerBI.the background of the dashboard.You can access the dashboard by downloading the 'Human Resources Dashboard.pbix'.
