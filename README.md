# Power-BI

# Sales Dashboard:
-I downloaded Sale's data from github, then opened it with Excel. After looking at columns I created a list of KPI that I could calculate and visualised to monitor the besiness. after choosing appropriate visual for each KPI and lokating them on the screen, I created a background using PowerPoint and imported as a wallpaper to PowerBI.
